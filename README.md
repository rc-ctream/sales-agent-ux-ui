# RAMI Dashboard – UX/UI Design Task

## 📖 User Story  
**As a Company Administrator**  
I want to create a **Support or Sales Agent** in the **RAMI Dashboard**,  
assign predefined tasks to it,  
and then see which tasks have been completed and their current status,  
so that I can deploy the agent efficiently and monitor its work.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria  

### 1. Create Agents  
- I can define the agent’s **name, description, avatar/icon, and area of responsibility**.  
- The agent is saved in my **overview list** and is immediately visible.  

### 2. Assign Tasks  
- I can select from a **list of predefined tasks** (see below).  
- I can **enable/disable** tasks.  

### 3. Overview & Status  
- I can see all agents in a **dashboard** with their status (*active, paused, offline*).  
- I have access to an **activity log** where each completed task is listed with its status (*in progress, completed, failed*).  
- *(Optional)* I can filter tasks by **time period** or **status**.
