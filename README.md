**User Story (for the UX/UI Designer)**
As a company administrator
I want to create a Support Agent in the RAMI Dashboard,
assign predefined tasks to it,
and then see which tasks have been completed and what their current status is,
so that I can deploy the agent efficiently and monitor its work.

**Acceptance Criteria (for clarity)**

1. **Create Agents**

   * I can define the agent’s name, description, avatar/icon, and area of responsibility.
   * The agent is saved in my overview list and is immediately visible.

2. **Assign Tasks**

   * I can select from a list of predefined tasks (e.g., answering emails, prioritizing tickets, responding to FAQs).
   * I can enable/disable tasks.

3. **Overview & Status**

   * I can see all agents in a dashboard with their status (active, paused, offline).
   * I have access to an activity log where each completed task is listed with its status (“in progress,” “completed,” “failed”).
   * Optional: I can filter tasks by time period or status.

**Design Task for the Candidate**
👉 Create 3–4 key screens as wireframes or mockups:

1. **Dashboard / Overview of all agents** – list or card view with status indicators.
2. **Agent Creation Form** – input form with agent details.
3. **Task Assignment View** – UI for selecting/assigning tasks.
4. **Agent Activity Log** – table or timeline with completed tasks and status.
